# ObjectDetection On Satellite Imagery

## Abstract
Satellite images are widely used for various applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model based on Faster R-CNN to accu- rately detect and classify objects in satellite images. We will train the model on the spacenet 7 dataset of satel- lite images and evaluate its performance. Additionally, we explored various techniques such as data augmen- tation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the modelâ€™s performance. 

## Respository Details:
Experiments: We tried the implementation on Faster-Rcnn and SSD models which didnt gave the satisfactory results.

sd5292_yn2224_bgs8255.ipynb: We have developed and implemented a neural network- based solution to detect building footprints on the SpaceNet 7 dataset. In our approach, we primarily focus on performing segmentation to identify buildings within individual images, disregarding the temporal aspect of the original challenge. To facilitate the development process, we utilize fastai, a PyTorch-based deep learn- ing library.
